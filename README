# Assignment 1

This assignment implements three classes: Interaction, DalleInteraction, and PromptManager. The Interaction class stores prompts and responses and is capable of displaying them. The DalleInteraction class inherits from Interaction and adds the ability to store image URLs. The PromptManager class can record both regular prompts and Dalle prompts, and it is capable of removing prompts.

## Getting Started

To install: `npm install`  
To run: `npm run start`

This run the src/index.js which test DalleInteraction and PromptManager functionalities.

## Feature

This project introduces a Console Interaction Interface, a powerful feature designed to facilitate direct communication between the user and the application through the command line interface (CLI). This interface enables users to input commands, respond to prompts, and receive immediate feedback and outputs directly in the console.
