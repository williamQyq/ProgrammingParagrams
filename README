# Assignment 1

This assignment implements three classes: Interaction, DalleInteraction, and PromptManager. The Interaction class stores prompts and responses and is capable of displaying them. The DalleInteraction class inherits from Interaction and adds the ability to store image URLs. The PromptManager class can record both regular prompts and Dalle prompts, and it is capable of removing prompts.

`This assignment does utilizing ESM syntax for import/export, but the TypeScript configuration in package.json and tsconfig.json must remain as 'CommonJS' and cannot be changed.`
